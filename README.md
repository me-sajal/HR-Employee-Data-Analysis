# HR-Employee-Data-Analysis
## Introduction

Welcome to the HR Employee Data Analysis project! This Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file contains a comprehensive analysis of human resource data focusing on employee promotions within a 5-year timeframe and employee attrition. We have conducted data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and built classification models using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees.

## Contents

- Data Preprocessing:
    - Handling Missing Values: Filling missing values using the mode (most frequent) value.
    - Splitting the data into target variable and features.

- Exploratory Data Analysis:
    - Assumption: Promotion in 5 years bar.
    - Distribution of employees by department and attrition.
    - Distribution of employees by salary and attrition.
    - Correlation heatmap.
    - Satisfaction level histogram.
    - Average monthly hours histogram.
    - Number of employees by department.

- Classification Models:
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) modeling.
    - Logistic Regression modeling.
    - Decision Tree modeling.
    
- Model Performance Comparison:
    - Confusion matrix for KNN.
    - Confusion matrix for Logistic Regression.
    - Confusion matrix for Decision Tree.
    
- Count Plot of "left" Categories.
- EDA for Department distribution.
- EDA for salary distribution.
- EDA of promotion last 5 years distribution.
- EDA for Correlation heat maps.

## Conclusion

This analysis is part of a classification task where we predict whether an employee will leave (1) or stay (0) in the company within a 5-year period based on various features. Classification is an appropriate approach for this problem, given its categorical target variable and the need to classify instances into different classes.

We have explored the data thoroughly, handled missing values, and built three different classification models to predict employee attrition. By comparing their performance using confusion matrices, we aim to provide valuable insights for HR decision-making.

Feel free to explore the analysis and models further to gain a deeper understanding of the HR employee data.
